    "text": "valentine's day, also called saint valentine's day or the feast of saint valentine,&#91;1&#93; is celebrated annually on february 14.&#91;2&#93; it originated as a christian feast day honoring one or two early christian martyrs named saint valentine. through later folk traditions, it has become a significant cultural, religious, and commercial celebration of romance and love in many regions of the world.&#91;3&#93;there are a number of martyrdom stories associated with various valentines connected to february 14,&#91;4&#93; including an account of the imprisonment of saint valentine of rome for ministering to christians persecuted under the roman empire in the third century.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93; according to an early tradition, saint valentine restored sight to the blind daughter of his jailer.&#91;7&#93; numerous later additions to the legend have better related it to the theme of love: an 18th-century embellishment to the legend claims he wrote the jailer's daughter a letter signed \"your valentine\" as a farewell before his execution;&#91;8&#93; another tradition posits that saint valentine performed weddings for christian soldiers who were forbidden to marry.&#91;6&#93;the 8th century gelasian sacramentary recorded the celebration of the feast of saint valentine on february 14.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; the day became associated with romantic love in the 14th and 15th centuries when notions of courtly love flourished, apparently by association with the \"lovebirds\" of early spring. in 18th-century england, it grew into an occasion in which couples expressed their love for each other by presenting flowers, offering confectionery, and sending greeting cards, known as \"valentines\". valentine's day symbols that are used today include the heart-shaped outline, doves, and the figure of the winged cupid. since the 19th century, handwritten valentines have given way to mass-produced greeting cards.&#91;11&#93; in italy, saint valentine's keys are given to lovers \"as a romantic symbol and an invitation to unlock the giver's heart\", as well as to children to ward off epilepsy, called saint valentine's malady.&#91;12&#93;john foxe, an english historian, as well as the order of carmelites, state that saint valentine was buried in the church of praxedes in rome, located near the cemetery of saint hippolytus. this order says that according to legend, \"julia herself planted a pink-blossomed almond tree near his grave. today, the almond tree remains a symbol of abiding love and friendship.\"&#91;36&#93;&#91;37&#93;according to legend, in order \"to remind these men of their vows and god's love, saint valentine is said to have cut hearts from parchment\", giving them to these soldiers and persecuted christians, a possible origin of the widespread use of hearts on st. valentine's day.&#91;41&#93;saint valentine supposedly wore a purple amethyst ring, customarily worn on the hands of christian bishops with an image of cupid engraved in it, a recognizable symbol associated with love that was legal under the roman empire;&#91;39&#93;&#91;42&#93; roman soldiers would recognize the ring and ask him to perform marriage for them.&#91;39&#93; probably due to the association with saint valentine, amethyst has become the birthstone of february, which is thought to attract love.&#91;43&#93;while the european folk traditions connected with saint valentine and st. valentine's day have become marginalized by modern customs connecting the day with romantic love, there are still some connections with the advent of spring.\nin slovenia, saint valentine or zdravko was one of the saints of spring, the saint of good health and the patron of beekeepers and pilgrims.&#91;46&#93;\na proverb says that \"saint valentine brings the keys of roots\". plants and flowers start to grow on this day. it has been celebrated as the day when the first work in the vineyards and in the fields commences. it is also said that birds propose to each other or marry on that day. another proverb says \"valentin – prvi spomladin\" (\"valentine – the first spring saint\"), as in some places (especially white carniola), saint valentine marks the beginning of spring.&#91;47&#93;valentine's day has only recently been celebrated as the day of love. the day of love was traditionally march 12, the saint gregory's day, or february 22, saint vincent's day. the patron of love was saint anthony, whose day has been celebrated on june 13.&#91;46&#93;the \"feast\" (latin: \"in natali\", lit.: on the birthday) of saint valentine originated in christendom and has been marked by the western church of christendom in honour of one of the christian martyrs named valentine, as recorded in the 8th century gelasian sacramentary.&#91;21&#93;&#91;10&#93; in ancient rome, lupercalia was observed february 13–15 on behalf of pan &amp; juno, pagan gods of love, marriage &amp; fertility. it was a rite connected to purification and health, and had only slight connection to fertility (as a part of health) and none to love. the celebration of saint valentine is not known to have had any romantic connotations until chaucer's poetry about \"valentine's day\" in the 14th century, some seven hundred years after celebration of lupercalia is believed to have ceased.&#91;29&#93;some researchers have theorized that gelasius i replaced lupercalia with the celebration of the purification of the blessed virgin mary and claim a connection to the 14th century's connotations of romantic love, but there is no historical indication that he ever intended such a thing.&#91;notes 2&#93;&#91;49&#93;&#91;50&#93; also, the dates do not fit because at the time of gelasius i, the feast was only celebrated in jerusalem, and it was on february 14 only because jerusalem placed the nativity of jesus (christmas) on january 6.&#91;notes 3&#93; although it was called \"purification of the blessed virgin mary\", it also dealt with the presentation of jesus at the temple.&#91;51&#93; jerusalem's purification of the blessed virgin mary on february 14 became the presentation of jesus at the temple on february 2 as it was introduced to rome and other places in the sixth century, after gelasius i's time.&#91;51&#93;the first recorded association of valentine's day with romantic love is believed to be in the parliament of fowls (1382) by geoffrey chaucer, a dream vision portraying a parliament for birds to choose their mates.&#91;29&#93; honoring the first anniversary of the engagement of fifteen-year-old king richard ii of england to fifteen-year-old anne of bohemia,&#91;52&#93; chaucer wrote (in middle english):\nthe earliest description of february 14 as an annual celebration of love appears in the charter of the court of love. the charter, allegedly issued by charles vi of france at mantes-la-jolie in 1400, describes lavish festivities to be attended by several members of the royal court, including a feast, amorous song and poetry competitions, jousting and dancing.&#91;60&#93; amid these festivities, the attending ladies would hear and rule on disputes from lovers.&#91;61&#93; no other record of the court exists, and none of those named in the charter were present at mantes except charles's queen, isabeau of bavaria, who may well have imagined it all while waiting out a plague.&#91;60&#93;the earliest surviving valentines in english appear to be those in the paston letters, written in 1477 by margery brewes to her future husband john paston \"my right well-beloved valentine\".&#91;64&#93;the honey's sweet, and so are you.\nthou art my love and i am thine;\ni drew thee to my valentine:\nthe lot was cast and then i drew,in 1797, a british publisher issued the young man's valentine writer, which contained scores of suggested sentimental verses for the young lover unable to compose his own. printers had already begun producing a limited number of cards with verses and sketches, called \"mechanical valentines.\" paper valentines became so popular in england in the early 19th century that they were assembled in factories. fancy valentines were made with real lace and ribbons, with paper lace introduced in the mid-19th century.&#91;68&#93; in 1835, 60,000 valentine cards were sent by post in the united kingdom, despite postage being expensive.&#91;69&#93;the rise of internet popularity at the turn of the millennium is creating new traditions. millions of people use, every year, digital means of creating and sending valentine's day greeting messages such as e-cards, love coupons or printable greeting cards. valentine's day is considered by some to be a hallmark holiday due to its commercialization.&#91;86&#93;in most latin american countries, for example, costa rica,&#91;91&#93; mexico,&#91;92&#93; and the u.s.territory of puerto rico, saint valentine's day is known as día de los enamorados ('day of lovers')&#91;93&#93; or as día del amor y la amistad ('day of love and friendship'). it is also common to see people perform \"acts of appreciation\" for their friends.&#91;94&#93;in brazil, the dia dos namorados (lit. \"lovers' day\", or \"boyfriends'/girlfriends' day\") is celebrated on june 12, probably because that is the day before saint anthony's day, known there as the 'marriage saint',&#91;citation needed&#93; when traditionally many single women perform popular rituals, called simpatias, in order to find a good husband or boyfriend. couples exchange gifts, chocolates, cards, and flower bouquets. the february 14 valentine's day is not celebrated at all because it usually falls too little before or too little after the brazilian carnival&#91;97&#93; – that can fall anywhere from early february to early march and lasts almost a week. because of the absence of valentine's day and due to the celebrations of the carnivals, brazil was recommended by u.s. news &amp; world report as a tourist destination during february for western singles who want to get away from the holiday.&#91;98&#93;in pre-taliban years koch-e-gul-faroushi (flower street) in the down town kabul used to be adorned with  innovative flower arrangements to attract valentine's day celebrating youth.&#91;104&#93; in the afghan tradition, love is often expressed through poetry. some new generation budding poets like ramin mazhar, mahtab sahel are expressing themselves through poetry using valentine's day expressing concerns on any likelihood of erosion of freedoms. in their political comment they defy fear by saying i kiss you amid the taliban.&#91;105&#93;&#91;106&#93;valentine's day was first celebrated in bangladesh by shafik rehman, a journalist and editor of jaijaidin in 1993. he was acquainted with western culture by studying in london.&#91;107&#93; he highlighted valentine's day to the bangladeshi people through jaijaidin newspaper. rehman is called the \"father of valentine's day in bangladesh\".&#91;108&#93; on this day, people in various bonds including lovers, friends, husbands and wives, mothers and children, students and teachers express their love for each other with flowers, chocolates, cards and other gifts. on this day, various parks and recreation centers of the country are full of people of love.&#91;109&#93;&#91;110&#93; no public holiday is declared on this day in bangladesh.\nin chinese, valentine's day is called lovers' festival (simplified chinese&#58; 情人节; traditional chinese&#58; 情人節; mandarin: qīng rén jié; hokkien: chêng lîn chiat; cantonese: chìhng yàhn jit; shanghainesexin yin jiq). the \"chinese valentine's day\" is the qixi festival (meaning \"the night of sevens\" (chinese&#58; 七夕; pinyin&#58; qi xi)), celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar. according to the legend, the cowherd star and the weaver maid star are normally separated by the milky way (silvery river) but are allowed to meet by crossing it on the 7th day of the 7th month of the chinese calendar.&#91;115&#93;in ancient india, there was a tradition of adoring kamadeva, the lord of love — exemplified by the erotic carvings in the khajuraho group of monuments and by the writing of the kamasutra.&#91;117&#93; this tradition was lost around the middle ages, when kamadeva was no longer celebrated, and public displays of sexual affection became frowned upon.&#91;117&#93; this repression of public affections began to loosen in the 1990s.&#91;118&#93;valentine's day celebrations did not catch on in india until around 1992. it was spread due to the programs in commercial tv channels, such as mtv, dedicated radio programs, and love letter competitions, in addition to an economical liberalization that allowed the explosion of the valentine card industry.&#91;117&#93;&#91;119&#93; the celebration has caused a sharp change on how people have been displaying their affection in public since the middle ages.&#91;117&#93;in modern times, hindu and islamic&#91;123&#93; traditionalists have considered the holiday to be cultural contamination from the west, a result of globalization in india.&#91;117&#93;&#91;119&#93;shiv sena and the sangh parivar have asked their followers to shun the holiday and the \"public admission of love\" because of them being \"alien to indian culture\".&#91;124&#93; although these protests are organized by political elites, the protesters themselves are middle-class hindu men who fear that the globalization will destroy the traditions in their society: arranged marriages, hindu joint families, full-time mothers, etc.&#91;119&#93;&#91;123&#93; despite these obstacles, valentine's day is becoming increasingly popular in india.&#91;125&#93;valentine's day has been strongly criticized from a postcolonial perspective by intellectuals from the indian left. the holiday is regarded as a front for \"western imperialism\", \"neocolonialism\", and \"the exploitation of working classes through commercialism by multinational corporations\".&#91;126&#93; it is claimed that as a result of valentine's day, the working classes and rural poor become more disconnected socially, politically, and geographically from the hegemonic capitalist power structure. they also criticize mainstream media attacks on indians opposed to valentine's day as a form of demonization that is designed and derived to further the valentine's day agenda.&#91;127&#93;&#91;128&#93;\nright wing hindu nationalists are also hostile. in february 2012, subash chouhan of the bajrang dal warned couples that \"they cannot kiss or hug in public places. our activists will beat them up\".&#91;129&#93;\nhe said \"we are not against love, but we criticize vulgar exhibition of love at public places\".&#91;130&#93;in israel, the jewish tradition of tu b'av has been revived and transformed into the jewish equivalent of valentine's day. it is celebrated on the 15th day of the month of av (usually in late august). in ancient times girls would wear white dresses and dance in the vineyards, where the boys would be waiting for them (mishna taanith end of chapter 4). today, tu b'av is celebrated as a second holiday of love by secular people (along with valentine's day), and it shares many of the customs associated with saint valentine's day in western societies. in modern israeli culture tu b'av is a popular day to proclaim love, propose marriage, and give gifts like cards or flowers.&#91;135&#93;many women feel obliged to give chocolates to all male co-workers, except when the day falls on a sunday, a holiday. this is known as giri-choko (義理チョコ), from 'giri' (\"obligation\") and 'choko', (\"chocolate\"), with unpopular co-workers receiving only \"ultra-obligatory\" (超義理チョコ 'chō-giri choko') cheap chocolate. this contrasts with honmei-choko (本命チョコ, lit. \"true feeling chocolate\"), chocolate given to a loved one. friends, especially girls, may exchange chocolate referred to as tomo-choko (友チョコ, from 'tomo' meaning \"friend\").&#91;140&#93;saint valentine is the patron saint for a large part of the lebanese population. couples take the opportunity of valentine's feast day to exchange sweet words and gifts as proof of love. such gifts typically include boxes of chocolates, cupcakes, and red roses, which are considered the emblem of sacrifice and passion.&#91;citation needed&#93;lebanese people celebrate valentine's day in a different way in every city. in beirut, men take women out to dine and may buy them a gift. many women are asked to marry on that day. in sidon, valentine's day is celebrated with the whole family – it is more about family love than a couple's love.&#91;citation needed&#93;islamic officials in west malaysia warned muslims against celebrating valentine's day, linking it with vice activities. deputy prime minister muhyiddin yassin said the celebration of romantic love was \"not suitable\" for muslims. wan mohamad sheikh abdul aziz, head of the malaysian islamic development department (jakim), which oversees the country's islamic policies said that a fatwa (ruling) issued by the country's top clerics in 2005 noted that the day 'is associated with elements of christianity,' and 'we just cannot get involved with other religions' worshipping rituals.' jakim officials planned to carry out a nationwide campaign called \"awas jerat valentine's day\" (\"mind the valentine's day trap\"), aimed at preventing muslims from celebrating the day on february 14, 2011. activities include conducting raids in hotels to stop young couples from having unlawful sex and distributing leaflets to muslim university students warning them against the day.&#91;142&#93;&#91;143&#93;in south korea, women give chocolate to men on february 14, and men give non-chocolate candy to women on march 14 (white day). on april 14 (black day), those who did not receive anything on february or march 14 go to a chinese-korean restaurant to eat black noodles (짜장면 jajangmyeon) and lament their 'single life'.&#91;139&#93; koreans also celebrate pepero day on november 11, when young couples give each other pepero cookies. the date '11/11' is intended to resemble the long shape of the cookie. the 14th of every month marks a love-related day in korea, although most of them are obscure. from january to december: candle day, valentine's day, white day, black day, rose day, kiss day, silver day, green day, music day, wine day, movie day, and hug day.&#91;168&#93; korean women give a much higher amount of chocolate than japanese women.&#91;139&#93;st. valentine's day, or ημέρα του αγίου βαλεντίνου in greek tradition was not associated with romantic love. in the eastern orthodox church there is another saint who protects people who are in love, hyacinth of caesarea (feast day july 3), but this was not widely known until the late 1990s&#91;171&#93; in contemporary greece, valentine's day is generally celebrated as in the common western tradition.&#91;172&#93;on saint valentine's day in ireland, many individuals who seek true love make a christian pilgrimage to the shrine of st. valentine in whitefriar street carmelite church in dublin, which is said to house relics of saint valentine of rome; they pray at the shrine in hope of finding romance.&#91;173&#93; there lies a book in which foreigners and locals have written their prayer requests for love.&#91;174&#93;in portugal, the holiday is known as \"dia dos namorados\" (lover's day / day of the enamoured). as elsewhere, couples exchange gifts, but in some regions, women give a lenço de namorados (\"lovers' handkerchief\"), which is usually embroidered with love motifs.&#91;176&#93;in recent years, romania has also started celebrating valentine's day. this has drawn backlash from several groups, institutions,&#91;177&#93; and nationalist organizations like noua dreaptǎ, who condemn valentine's day for being superficial, commercialist, and imported western kitsch. in order to counter the perceived denaturation of national culture, dragobete, a spring festival celebrated in parts of southern romania, has been rekindled after having been ignored during the communist years as the traditional romanian holiday for lovers. the holiday is named after a character from romanian folklore who was supposed to be the son of baba dochia.&#91;178&#93; its date used to vary depending on the geographical area, however nowadays it is commonly observed on february 24.&#91;179&#93;in wales, some people celebrate dydd santes dwynwen (st. dwynwen's day) on january 25 instead of (or as well as) valentine's day. the day commemorates st dwynwen, the welsh patron saint of love.&#91;184&#93; the welsh name for saint valentine is sant ffolant.\n"
